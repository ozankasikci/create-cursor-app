# AI Assistant Instructions

## Critical Context Files
ALWAYS check and analyze these files before any action:
- CHANGELOG.md - Contains project history and documentation protocols
- PROJECT_SCOPE.md - Contains project goals, architecture, and boundaries

## Required Behavior
1. Start EVERY conversation by:
   - Reading CHANGELOG.md and PROJECT_SCOPE.md
   - Reporting key findings relevant to current task
   - Following all documentation protocols

2. After ANY changes:
   - Update CHANGELOG.md with changes
   - Update PROJECT_SCOPE.md if architecture/scope changes
   - Report what was updated

3. Never skip documentation updates
   - Document before responding to user
   - Keep changes tracked and organized
   - Maintain project continuity

## Self-Maintenance Protocol
```
Read required files → Report findings → Make changes → Update docs → Respond to user
```

Remember: Documentation and context awareness are mandatory, not optional.
